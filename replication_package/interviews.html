      <p class="lead">
        To assess the plausibility, clarity, and relevance of the proposed taxonomy of Agentic AI in Software Engineering,
        we conducted an expert-based validation.

        <h2>Expert-based validation</h2>
        <p class="small">
          Given the conceptual and socio-technical nature of the contribution, the goal of this validation was not to empirically
          test predictive claims, but to critically examine whether the identified agent types, associated benefits, risks, and changes
          constitute a meaningful and useful conceptual framework from the perspective of domain experts.
        </p>
        <p class="small">
          The validation involved <strong>6 experts</strong> with experience in software engineering and Agentic AI, including both
          academic researchers and industry practitioners. All participants had prior familiarity with AI-assisted or agent-based
          systems in software engineering contexts. Participation was voluntary; experts were informed that the validation focused on
          the conceptual soundness of the taxonomy rather than evaluating specific tools or implementations.
